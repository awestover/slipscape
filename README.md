I'm in it for the vector maths, not the annoying webgl stuff.
I think I still get plenty of vector math if I do stupid stuff like, I dunno, writing my own physics engine? XD
anyways, point being, this is all for fun,
so I'm gonna use threejs for nothing but drawing cubes, and moving them around!
the rest is math I'm willing / eager to do 


# TODO
